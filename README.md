# HDFS-Project
This project is about designing a star schema for the given dataset and implementing it on HDFS using CSV, Avro, and Parquet formats. It involves comparing the formats based on size, write speed, and read speed, as well as experimenting with various compression levels and algorithms for Avro and Parquet.
